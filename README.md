# Challenge Your Skills

### Code-Quiz

## Description 

For the code quiz assignment, our task was to build, from scratch, a quiz using html, css and javascript. I started off by creating the repository folder structure with the assets within these folders. I then opened my index.html file and used emmet to create my html:5 layout. Next was creating the css style sheet and adding styles to the document. I noticed an additional html file was needed, so I created a page called high-score. For javascript, I started off by creating pseudocode for each line of the acceptance criteria. 

In this project, I really enjoyed doing the html and css portion, I noticed I was able to write the code without much reference. Using html, I made the "View High Scores" text link to the second html document. I also was able to add links to the buttons on the high-score page to "go back" to the index html. 

For javascript, I had difficulty in accomplishing a few key functions. I wanted to submit something rather than nothing for this assignment to show my progress. How far I got with Javascript was, I was able to define the variables for the timer and start quiz button. I then created a timer function and made it so when the "start quiz" button is clicked (using the addEventListener,)  the timer starts. I was able to get the intro code block to hide and the first question to show. I also laid out the questions in the javascript file including title, choices and solution. 

I used several references to try to complete this assignment. W3Schools.com was a very helpful, I also used askBCS, attended tutoring hours as well as visiting with my tutor 1-1. I wanted to meet the submission deadline and submit something and come back and revisit it later. I enjoyed how far I got in this challenge and look forward to revisiting.
