# Challenge Your Skills - Code-Quiz

## Description 

For the code quiz assignment, our task was to build from scratch a quiz using html, css and javascript. I started off by using emmet to create my html:5 layout. I built out the header section, the navigation section (using unordered lists) and the intro section. I then created a css style sheet and added styles to the document. Next I noticed an additional HTML file was needed, so I created high-score.html and added the emmet code. For javascript, I started off by creating pseudocode for each line of the acceptance criteria. 

In this project, I really enjoyed doing the html and css portion, I noticed I was able to write the code without much reference. Using HTML, I made the "View high scores" text link to the second html document. I also was able to add links to the buttons on the high-score page to "go back" to the index html. 

For javascript, I had difficulty in accomplishing a few key functions. I wanted to submit something rather than nothing. How far I got with Javascript was, I was able to define the variables for the timer and start quiz button. I then created a timer function and made it so when the "start quiz" button is clicked with the addEventListener, the timer starts. I tried using clearInterval to stop the timer when it hit zero but was having issues making this code work. Next I tried to create syntax for the psuedocode "if start quiz button is clicked, then hide coding quiz challenge and start the first question". I was able to get the intro code block to hide, however had difficulty navgiating having the first question appear. 

I used several references to try to complete this assignment. W3Schools.com was very helpful during this project, I also used askBCS and attended tutoring hours on saturday. I wanted to meet the submission deadline and submit something and come back and revisit it later as I fear of falling behind. I enjoyed how far I got in this challenge and look forward to revisiting.

## Installation

To install the project, you need to git pull the following files from <a href ="https://github.com/abauer424/code-quiz">my repository:</a> index.html, high-score.html, script.js, style.css, images, README.md and .gitignore. 


## Usage 

1) Upon page load, you will see the image below is how the page should appear. You will see the header introduction "Challenge Your Skills!" complimented by a paragraph that gives an introduction to the quiz. You will also notice in the navigation two sections: "View High Scores" and "Time:".

2) When the "View High Scores" text is clicked it will take you to the page below. Here is where the user can either go back or clear high scores. This was a section of the assignment I was unable to complete on time and plan to revisit.

3) When the user clicks "go back" from the previous page, it will lead them back to the main index page. If the user hovers over the "start quiz" button, the button will turn green and if the user clicks the button the timer in the right hand corner will start. I had difficulty executing how to stop the timer, I noticed it goes into the negatives.
